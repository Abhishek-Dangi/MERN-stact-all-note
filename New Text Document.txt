what  is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area. 

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)


async function

An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

JavaScript types

    Boolean type.
    Null type.
    Undefined type.
    Number type.
    BigInt type.
    String type.
    Symbol type.


What is a Function ?

A Function is a block of code that is designed to perform a task and executed when it is been called or invoked.

There are 3 ways of writing a function in JavaScript:

    Function Declaration
    Function Expression
    Arrow Function

JSON 
JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. JSON is a text-based data format that is used to store and transfer data. For example,

What is the DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.

What Is Express JS?     

Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.
Features of Express JS

    Fast Server-Side Development 

The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

    Middleware

Middleware is a request handler that has access to the application's request-response cycle.

    Routing 

It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

    Templating 

It provides templating engines to build dynamic content on the web pages by creating HTML templates on the server.

    Debugging 

Express makes it easier as it identifies the exact part where bugs are.

Advantages of Using Express With Node.js

    Express is Unopinionated, and we can customize it.
    For request handling, we can use Middleware.
    A single language is used for frontend and backend development.
    Express is fast to link it with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
    ​​Express allows dynamic rendering of HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
